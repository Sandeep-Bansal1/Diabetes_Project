## Project Overview
---
- <b>Data</b> - Two datasets were used for modeling and reference. 
  - The raw dataset can be found on the Kaggle website, [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). 
  - The Maryland Dataset can be found [here](https://opendata.maryland.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Number-of-Diabetes-Deaths-among-Maryland-Residents/smru-f5wc)
- <b>Research</b> 
  - Emma Wilmot Department of Diabetes & Endocrinology & Iskandar Idris Royal Derby Hospital and Division of Medical Sciences & Graduate Entry Medicine, University   of Nottingham Title: "Early onset type 2 diabetes: risk factors, clinical impact and management" can be found 
  [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2040622314548679)

- <b>Buisness Objective </b> - Using Logistic Regression can a machine learning model accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?
