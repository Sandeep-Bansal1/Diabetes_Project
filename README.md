## Project Overview
- <b>Data</b> - Two datasets were used for modeling and reference. The raw dataset can be found on the Kaggle website, [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). The Maryland Dataset can be found [here](https://opendata.maryland.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Number-of-Diabetes-Deaths-among-Maryland-Residents/smru-f5wc)
- <b>Research</b> 
  - Emma Wilmot Department of Diabetes & Endocrinology & Iskandar Idris Royal Derby Hospital and Division of Medical Sciences & Graduate Entry Medicine, University   of Nottingham Title: "Early onset type 2 diabetes: risk factors, clinical impact and management" can be found

## Buisness Objective </b> 
- Using Logistic Regression can a machine learning model accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?

## Abstract and Introduction:
- The worldwide prevalence of DM has risen dramatically over the past two decades, from an estimated 30 million cases in 1985 to 415 million in 2017. According to the article titled "Early onset of type 2 diabetes: risk factorsm clinical impact and management", statistics state the Global estimate for Diabetes Mellitus is approximatly 415 million in 2017. Regional estimates of the number of individuals with diabetes (20â€“79 years of age) are shown (2017).Based on current trends, the IDF projects that 642 million individuals will have diabetes by the year 2040.

## Motivation: 
- Approximately 623,041 people in Maryland, or 12.6% of the adult population, have diabetes. Of these, an estimated 156,000 have diabetes butare unaware of it, greatly increasing their health risk. In addition, 1,634,000 people in Maryland, 36.9% of the adult population, have prediabetes with blood glucose levels higher than normal but not yet high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes.

## Proposed Method of Modeling:
- Logistic regression is one such regression algorithm which can be used for performing classification problems. It calculates the probability that a given value belongs to a specific class. If the probability is more than 50%, it assigns the value in that particular class else if the probability is less than 50%, the value is assigned to the other class. Therefore, we can say that logistic regression acts as a binary classifier.
- For this project we will calculate the probability that a patient has diabetes which will be labeled the dependent variable. 0 = Not Diabetic, 1 = Patient is Diabetic
